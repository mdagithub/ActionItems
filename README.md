ActionItems
===========

This respository contains the list of actions items to be managed during the course of the project.

1) Action Items should be entered as they are identified during meetings, from minutes, discussions etc.  with Status "s-New".  
2) As they are reviewed by the Action Item Repository Maintainer/Owner the status can be updated to "s-Open".  
3) As Action Items are assigned/reviewed/discussed, etc. the ongoing diaglog should be recorded in the comments and status should be "s-InProgress".  Ideally, they will also have a milestone/date assigned as well.  
4) When an action item is considered completed, a comment on the resolution should be added and the status updated to "s-Completed".  
6) When the Action Item Repository Maintainer/Owner has confirmed with the applicable stakeholders about the completed action items, the Action Item can be 'Closed'.  
7) Some Action Items may not be relevant/applicable or perhaps a duplicate; so they should be statused as "s-Withdrawn/NA", or "s-Duplicate" and then eventually closed as per step 6).
